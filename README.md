'''
How to use:
1. Add your Google API key to env.py file
2. Only change the prompt Goal and Operating system in the prompt variable below.
3. Keep the window you want to automate as the second window behind the first one ex. google sheets behind VS code editor.

Description:
1. Once the script is ran, the script will hide the first window ex. vs code editor.
2. Next the second window behind the first will be screenshotted and sent with the prompt to the AI.
3. The AI will generate a list of steps to accomplish the goal.
4. The script parses the AI response and execute the steps using pyautogui.
5. The script filters out some letters from the results if conflicting with MacOS modifier keys.
6. The script executes the steps with a delay to allow for proper execution.

Note on Limitaions:
1. The AI will do based on 1 automated screenshot so if the window changes it won't work.
2. You will not be able to multitask while the script is running since the keyboard will in use.
3. Some keys are filtered out since MacOS may mistake them for modifier keys.
 - For example, 'm' and 'M' are filtered out from pyautogui commands
